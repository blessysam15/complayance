🏗️ Project Title

Invoicing ROI Simulator

🧠 Problem Statement

The objective is to build an application that helps small businesses or freelancers calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for their invoicing and payment operations. The tool demonstrates how automation or digital invoicing can save time, reduce errors, and improve financial outcomes compared to manual processes.

🎯 Objectives

Develop a functional web app using Flask.

Allow users to input key invoicing data: total invoices, average payment value, manual hours, and automation costs.

Compute ROI using the formula:

𝑅
𝑂
𝐼
=
Profit
−
Cost
Cost
×
100
ROI=
Cost
Profit−Cost
	​

×100

Visualize the results in a user-friendly interface.

Provide a report generation feature (PDF/HTML) for record-keeping or presentation.

⚙️ System Architecture
Frontend

HTML/CSS: Layout, forms, styling.

JavaScript: Form validation, AJAX requests for live results.

Backend

Flask (Python): Handles routing, computation logic, and API endpoints.

SQLite Database: Stores user inputs and computed results.

Data Flow

User opens the web form.

User submits invoicing details.

Flask server computes ROI and savings.

Results are displayed on a dedicated results page.

Optional: Generate and download report (PDF/HTML).

🧮 Core Features

Input Form – Capture:

Total invoices per month

Average value per invoice

Manual hours spent

Automation cost

Real-time ROI computation – Display immediate results.

Profit and Savings Overview – Highlight potential financial benefits.

Data Persistence – Store scenarios in SQLite for tracking and retrieval.

Report Export – Generate downloadable PDF or HTML summary.

🗂️ Database Design

Table: roi_data

Column Name	Type	Description
id	INTEGER	Primary Key, auto-increment
total_invoices	INTEGER	Number of invoices processed
avg_value	REAL	Average value per invoice
manual_hours	REAL	Hours spent manually
automation_cost	REAL	Cost of automation software
roi_percentage	REAL	Calculated ROI
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Date of entry
🧮 Calculation Logic

Manual Cost = manual_hours * hourly_rate
Savings = Manual Cost - automation_cost
ROI (%) = (Savings / automation_cost) * 100

🧾 Sample Workflow

Open the homepage.

Enter invoice and cost details in the form.

Backend computes ROI and stores the scenario in the database.

Results page displays:

ROI percentage

Monthly savings

Payback period

Optional: Download report or start a new calculation.

🔍 Future Enhancements

Add login/authentication for multi-user tracking.

Integrate charts and visualizations using Chart.js.

Enable email notifications for sending reports automatically.

Upgrade database to PostgreSQL for scalability.

Savings = Manual Cost - automation_cost

ROI (%) = (Savings / automation_cost) * 100
